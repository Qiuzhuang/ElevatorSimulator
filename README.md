# ElevatorSimulator
Implements a simple elevator simulator with Reinforcement Learning. The reinforcement learning system is implemented using [http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rl/software.php](YORLL) library.

## Scheduling algorithms
The simulator implements the following algorithms:
* Longest Queue First
* Zoning
* Round Robin
* Up-Peak Group Elevator
* Three Passage Group Elevator
* Reinforcement Learning
